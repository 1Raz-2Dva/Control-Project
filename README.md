# Control-Project
## Task: 
Write a program that, from the array string, forms an array of strings whose length is less than or equal to 3 characters. The initial array can be entered using the keyboard, or the start of the algorithm can be specified. It is not recommended to use collections in the solution; it is better to use arrays exclusively.
