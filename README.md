# Control-Project
## Task: 
### Write a program that, from the array string, forms an array of strings whose length is less than or equal to 3 characters. The initial array can be entered using the keyboard, or the start of the algorithm can be specified. It is not recommended to use collections in the solution; it is better to use arrays exclusively.
## Solution:
### 1 Create Array (String).
### 2 Fill the Array.
### 3 Count the number of elements of the array (which length is less or equal to 3 symbols).
### 4 Create new array of size equal to the number of counted elements.
### 5 Fill the new array with elements which length is less or equal to 3 symbols. 
## Attached files
### 1 This README file with task and attached files.
### 2 Scheme with algorithm created at Draw.io.
### 3 Program with solution.
